General:
This progect represents an AgCubio game. This game establishes a connection to a server and recieves constant 
game world data from the server. This application simply displays the ever-changing world information. To begin to play,
open the application, enter your player name and server name, and press "enter". After doing so, the game world will begin
to be displayed. 

How To Play:
The object of the game is for the player to eat food (by moving over it) and to grow in size. To move your cube, simply
move your mouse. The player cube will follow the mouse. Cubes can only eat food and other players that are smaller than
themselves, and can only be eaten by players who are bigger. One special feature is that of the "split" function. To split,
simply press "space" and your cube will split in half and move faster. This will make your player cube more vunerable to other
cubes for a short time, until your cube re-combines back into its total mass. (NOTE: Smaller cubes move faster than larger ones)
Have fun!


TA's:
Our implementation is mostly complete, but not fully up to the specs on the assignment page. We were unable to get the zoom to work correctly, 
so we decided to leave it out. We thought that we would rather turn in a product that was playable, and looked good, as opposed to having
a weird zooming effect that didn't quite work. In addition to this, our game view lags a bit (as you will no doubt see when you start playing)
and some cubes are never removed from the screen. After many hours of debugging, locking threads, and ensuring we are getting full correct 
data strings from the server, we felt that this was the best we could do with getting all the other features into the game. Hope you guys
enjoy it!

Cheers,
